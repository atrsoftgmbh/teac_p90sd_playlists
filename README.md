# teac_p90sd_playlists
helper to generate a playlist for a cd with perl systems

since i now have an teac p90 sd in and no use fro wiindows, i have to create playlists the hard way.

so i made alitle helper, its a perl script and you use it on the command line to make a list for a cd like directory.
you need to have the info files in, that is a thing most users likely forget to hold in if you use a ripper ...

but i have my files still in place, so the thing works at last for me.
